# Goals Fitness

## User Experience (UX)

A website built to best represent Goals Fitness Gym. The functionality of the website is very minimalistic, with focus on the User Experience being very simple. The idea is that it will remain informative, insightful and very easy to navigate.

## Nav-bar 

* As a potential customer, I want it to be easy to find my way round the website, so I can retrieve all the relevant information about the gym.

* As a website administrator, I want the navigation to be simple and familiar to the user, so they are able to find all of the important details about the gym.

* As a current gym member, I want the navigation to be simple and familiar, so that I can access any gym updates quickly.

## Call Out 

* As a potential customer, I want to know that I am getting a good deal for my money, so that I am more likely to sign up.

* As a website administrator, I would like the potential customer to be greeted with an offer, so that they are likely to move forward with signing up.

## Call Out Button

* As a potential customer, I want to see a large and clear sign up button, so I can easily claim my free months membership.

* As a website administrator, I want to include a brightly coloured, large sign up button, so that the end user can easily sign up.

## Contact Us

* As a potential customer, I want to be able to send enquiries to the website administrators, so that my queries can be responded to.

* As a website administrator, I want the end user to have the option to send in enquiries, so that I can respond to them.

## Social Media links

* As an end user, I want to see all of the social media links listed in one place, so that I can navigate straight to them.

* As a website administrator, I want the social media links to be advertised, so that the end user can look further into the gym across other platforms.


## Design Choices

### Fonts

* My font choices are ‘Quicksand’ and sans-serif as a back up choice.

* I chose Quicksand as it is rounded, clear and well suited to go with the minimalistic style of the rest of the website.
San-serif is the back up font as it is near to the Quicksand font, so it will also compliment the websites style in a similar way. 

## Icons

All icons used were taken from path/to/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css

* Dumbell - <i class="fas fa-dumbbell”>
* Clock - <i class="far fa-clock”>
* Key - <i class="fas fa-key”>
* Envelope - <i class="far fa-envelope”>
* Facebook - <i class="fab fa-facebook fa-2x”>
* Twitter - <i class="fab fa-twitter-square fa-2x”>
* Instagram - <i class="fab fa-instagram fa-2x”>

## Colours

My colour choices are a combination of three:
* #fc5a03
* #222021
* #00000;

The theme throughout is a white background, with the first section to be bright and encapsulating, the nav bar is bold and obvious, following a closely similar theme to the Hero Image. The Call Out header and button are the brightest of all three colours, to stand out with importance. All other written content is dark, except for the Submit button and Social Media icons, intentionally chosen not to overload the website with bright colour, keeping it easy to read. 

## Styling

My choice of style for the website is kept simple and minimalistic throughout. The navigation bar takes on a basic layout, which has been tailored to the website. This is so it’s familiar to the end user.
The Hero Image adapts to alternate screen sizes, without distorting the image, but instead cropping the image.
The content is kept short and informative, with a lot of focus on the images and the functionality of the website.
The website is made responsive to accommodate three main screen sizes; mobile, tablet and desktop. There  are no errors of transitioning between these.
