# Goals Fitness

## User Experience (UX)

A website built to best represent Goals Fitness Gym. The functionality of the website is very minimalistic, with focus on the User Experience being very simple. The idea is that it will remain informative, insightful and very easy to navigate.

## Languages used:

* HTML5

* CSS3


## Design Choices

### Fonts

* My font choices are ‘Quicksand’ and sans-serif as a back up choice.

* I chose Quicksand as it is rounded, clear and well suited to go with the minimalistic style of the rest of the website.
San-serif is the back up font as it is near to the Quicksand font, so it will also compliment the websites style in a similar way. 


## Icons

All icons used were taken from (path/to/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css)

* Dumbell - <i class="fas fa-dumbbell”>
* Clock - <i class="far fa-clock”>
* Key - <i class="fas fa-key”>
* Envelope - <i class="far fa-envelope”>
* Facebook - <i class="fab fa-facebook fa-2x”>
* Twitter - <i class="fab fa-twitter-square fa-2x”>
* Instagram - <i class="fab fa-instagram fa-2x”>


## Colours

My colour choices are a combination of three:
* #fc5a03
* #222021
* #00000;

The theme throughout is a white background, with the first section to be bright and encapsulating, the nav bar is bold and obvious, following a closely similar theme to the Hero Image. The Call Out header and button are the brightest of all three colours, to stand out with importance. All other written content is light, except for the Submit button and Social Media icons, intentionally chosen not to overload the website with bright colour, keeping it easy to read.
The initial theme which was created with wire frames, shows a white background with dark text throughout, however idea of this had changed in order to make the websites features stand out.


## Styling

My choice of style for the website is kept simple and minimalistic throughout. The navigation bar takes on a basic layout, which has been tailored to the website. This is so it’s familiar to the user.
The Hero Image adapts to alternate screen sizes, without distorting the image, but instead cropping the image.
The content is kept short and informative, with a lot of focus on the images and the functionality of the website.
The website is made responsive to accommodate three main screen sizes; mobile, tablet and desktop. There  are no errors of transitioning between these. 


## Technologies Used

* Google Fonts - (https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Fonts was used to implement a main font and a back up font for the website.
* Font Awesome - (https://fonts.google.com/) - Font Awesome was used to implement the Social Media icons.
* JQuery - (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js) - JQuery is used to coinside with the Bootstrap navbar and its responsiveness.
* Bootstrap CDN - (https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap structured the websites content in a responsive layout.
* Shoelace - (http://shoelace.io/) - Shoelace created the website columns structure, tailored for specific devices.
* Github - https://github.com/ - Github provides a version control system which was used for the development of this project.
* Gitpod - https://www.gitpod.io/ - Github was used as the main platform for running and distributing the code in this project.
* Balsamiq - https://balsamiq.com/buy/#d - Balsamiq software was used for creating the wire frames for this project.


## Frameworks Used

* Navbar - Bootstrap 4.5 - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/)
* Cards - Bootstrap 4.5 - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/)
* Table - Bootstrap 4.5 - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/tables/)
* Form - Bootstrap 4.5 - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/)


## Testing

* HTML checker -  https://validator.w3.org/
* CSS checker - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Both HTML and CSS pass through the checkers with no errors.


## Responsiveness:

Website is fully responsive on all devices.

Bootstrap 4.5 was used to create and support the websites responsiveness. A scrolling website was chosen as part of the design. On larger screens it was necessary for each of the 5 sections to individually be displayed taking up one whole visible page at a time. On mobiles, this is notably not possible, due to the screen size, however attributes and media queries were introduced in order to further separate the content, which defined more a page by page visible structure. The scrolling is enabled for downward scroll only, all overflow content on either side is hidden, with scroll-X disabled. 


### Devices tested:

* Samsung S10
* Apple iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, 10
* Apple ipad mini


### Browsers tested:

* Chrome - desktop and mobile
* Safari - desktop and mobile
* Firefox - desktop and mobile


### Load time:

* The site load time is averaging at 1 second for all devices tested.


### Additional finds:

When the form was passed through HTML validator, it flagged up the 'required’ attribute as an error for use with First Name and Second Name’s, I took this out and kept it only for email address. The Submit button does still work regardless or whether required fields are filled in, I acknowledge that this can be prevented by using Javascript.
